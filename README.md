# Text-Analytics
# Text Processing, Language Translation, and Social Network Analysis
## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive tool in Python for text processing, language translation, and social network analysis. It includes a range of functionalities that deal with text data manipulation, translation of English words to Latin, and analyzing social network relationships.

## Features
### Text Processing
- File Reading: Functions to read text from files and display the content.
- Text Cleaning: Removes punctuation and unnecessary whitespace, and converts text to lowercase.
- Sentence Segmentation: Splits text into individual sentences.

### Language Translation
- English to Latin Translation: Translates English words to Latin by rearranging letters and adding suffixes.
- Vowel Checking: Determines whether a word starts with a vowel to guide the translation process.

### Social Network Analysis
- Social Network Construction: Reads social relationships from files to build a network represented as a dictionary.
- Following Functionality: Determines whom a user is following within the network.

### Performance Evaluation
Uses the '%timeit' magic command to measure and compare the execution time of functions.

### Conclusion
This project showcases the integration of various Python functionalities for handling and analyzing text and network data. It provides a solid foundation for further exploration in text analysis, language translation, and social network dynamics.
